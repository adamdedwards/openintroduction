# README - For All X, Midwest Collaboration

## Introduction

This is a placeholder README file for the midwest fork of For All X, an open source logic textbook. The original textbook was created by P.D. Magnus. This version is based on the "Lorain County Remix" by Rob "Helpy Chalk" Loftis and with material by Cathal Woods. This version was created by Adam Edwards and incorporates material based on introductory logic courses taught at the Lincoln College Accelerated Bridge to Education (ABE) program.

## For Instructors

The intended audience of this textbook is students in introductory logic courses. The discussion and exercises are intended to give students a broad overview of Aristotelian categorical logic, propositional logic, predicate logic, and probability theory.
