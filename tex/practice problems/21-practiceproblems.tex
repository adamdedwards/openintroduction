\noindent\problempart
\label{ex_on_syllogism_patterns}
\answer{\\ The questions in this section were mostly meant to get you thinking about the issues we will be discussing in Section 5.4. Hopefully by looking for patterns in the 256 syllogisms, you can actually anticipate the rules we will demonstrate later on}

\begin{exercises}
\item Do you think there are any valid arguments in Aristotle's set of 256 syllogisms where both premises are particular? Why or why not? \label{itm:two_particulars}
\answer{\\No. You can intuitively see why this is the case when you remember that two particular premises could just be telling you about the existence of one or two particular objects, and you aren't going to be able to infer any generalities or any information about other particular objects from those two. For a more formal proof of why this is so, see see the discussion of Derived Rule 1 on page \ref{derived_rule_1}.}


\item Do you think there are any valid arguments in Aristotle's set of 256 syllogisms where both premises are negative? Why or why not?
\answer{\\No. You can see this by playing around with the Venn diagrams for negative statements, or by looking at the more formal proof of Rule 3 on page \ref{rule_3}.}

\item Can a valid argument have a negative statement in the conclusion, but only affirmative statements in the premises? Why or why not?
\answer{\\No. Again you can see this by playing around with Venn diagrams for negative statements, or by looking at the more formal proof of Rule 4 on page \ref{rule_4}}


\item Can a valid argument have an affirmative statement in the conclusion, but only one affirmative premise?
\answer{\\No, for the reasons stated above.}

\item Can a valid argument have two universal premises and a particular conclusion?
\answer{\\No, because the two universal statements do not have existential import, but the particular statement does. We will be talking more about this in the next section and in the proof of Rule 5 on page \ref{rule_5}.}

\item \label{itm:rainbow} I despise anything that cannot be used as a bridge. Everything, that is worth writing an ode to, would be a welcome gift to me. A rainbow will not bear the weight of a wheelbarrow.  Whatever can be used as a bridge will bear the weight of a wheel-barrow. I would not take, as a gift, a thing that I despise. Therefore a rainbow is not worth writing an ode to.

\item \label{itm:plum-pudding} A plum-pudding that is not really solid is mere porridge. Every plum-pudding served at my table has been boiled in a cloth. A plum-pudding that is mere porridge is indistinguishable from soup. No plum puddings are really solid except what are served at my table. Therefore no plum-pudding that has not been boiled in cloth can be distinguished from soup. %[four premise] LC

\item \label{itm:books} The only books in this library that I do \textit{not} recommend for reading are unhealthy in tone. All the bound books are well-written. All the romances are healthy in tone, and I do not recommend you read any of the unbound books. Therefore all the romances in this library are well-written.

\item \label{itm: poems} No interesting poems are unpopular among people of real taste. No modern poetry is free from affectation. All \textit{your} poems are on the subject of soap bubbles. No affected poetry is popular among people of real taste. No ancient poem is on the subject of soap-bubbles. Therefore all of \textit{your} poems are uninteresting. %[five premise] LC
